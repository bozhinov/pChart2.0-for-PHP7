  o Removed ImageMapper
  o Removed pCache
  o Moved fonts out of the pChart folder
  o Examples use the QRCode lib directly
  o Examples use the new Barcode lib
  o Explicitly declare the visibility for methods
  o BC: pScatter->drawScatterScale params DrawXLines & DrawYLines accept array
  o BC: pDraw->drawScale param DrawYLines accepts array
  o BC: pData->setAxisDisplay with AXIS_FORMAT_CUSTOM uses anonymous func as a param
  o BC: Removed pData methods
	importFromCSV
	setScatterSerieShape
	setScatterSerieDescription
	setScatterSeriePicture
	setScatterSerieDrawable
	setScatterSerieTicks
	setScatterSerieWeight
	setScatterSerieColor
	setXAxisName
	setXAxisDisplay
	setXAxisUnit

  o Added pData methods

	setScatterSerieProperties
	setSerieProperties

  o Added pDraw methods
	gettheImage
  	getShadow
  	restoreShadow
	setAntialias
	getFont
	getGraphAreaDiffs
	getGraphAreaCoordinates

  o Added benchmark script
  o FIXED: pDraw->setFilter
  o pData->XAxis data structure to match Axis[0]
